# DW2018
2018 - 10.009 : The Digital World - Solution Cache 

Solution cache for the weekly PSETs (Cohort/Homework/Extras), past year exam solutions, and DW-CHEM deliverables in Jupyter Notebook format. 
Week 2 PSET is rather straight forward and is hence omitted.
Solutions for DW-CHEM is included in the Jupyter Notebook labelled with the week it is due.
Check the bottom of the Week 5 Notebook for a combined DW-CHEM solution that includes Week 2 submissions.
